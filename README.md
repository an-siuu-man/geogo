# Geogo

#### Inspiration
After having to travel several times across the globe, it can be tough to navigate the documentation hassle that comes with crossing borders. Therefore, we decided to develop a website with over 100+ destinations that can quickly provide all the legal information you would need for you trip along with useful additional data as well as what to expect to spend on  your trip for an enhanced user experience. 

#### What it does
Picture this, you want to travel abroad, but you're just not too sure about what would be the best country given your budget. Additionally you have not considered visa requirements, requirements that may make some destinations impossible. Geogo is here to help users navigate this tricky proccess eliminating the worst parts of planning a trip. 

#### How we built it
With a lot of caffeine and locking in jokes we persevered to bring Geogo to what it is today by using several common web development techniques along with past knowledge in jss, html, and django. Like any website, a frontend was constructed by using jss, html, and css. We next developed the backend of our code, where a lot of data parsing and error handling was developed for Geogo.

#### Challenges we ran into
Parsing flight data from Google Flights API proved to be harder than expected. In addition, crash-proofing our code also took an unexpected large amount of time. Prior to picking a coding topic, there was also a large amount of time spent deciding which topic we were going to be coding this weekend.

#### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Geogo is able to simplify travel planning worldwide. With comprehensive database and intuitive interface we can proudly state that the user experience is as enhanced as it can be.

#### What we learned
We learned new methods for parsing large data sets from APIs, data acquisition, and of course we further enhanced our development capabilities.

#### What's next for Geogo
We hope to be able to extend our list of countries, enhance our API calls, and ADD SOMETHING HERE
